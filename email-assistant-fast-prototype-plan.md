  - Calendar integration mockup

- [ ] **Testing and refinement** (2 hours)
  - Cross-browser testing
  - Performance optimization
  - Bug fixes and polish

## Technical Stack (Rapid Prototype)

### Frontend
- **Base**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Styling**: Existing statsai-electron CSS variables
- **Icons**: Lucide icons (already integrated)
- **No additional dependencies** for speed

### Mock Data Sources
- **Static JSON files** for email data
- **LocalStorage** for user preferences
- **Simulated API responses** with timeouts

### Key Features for Prototype

#### Core Email Features
1. **Three-panel interface** with responsive design
2. **Email list** with sorting and basic filtering
3. **Email viewer** with rich text display
4. **Compose interface** with AI assistance mockup

#### AI Assistant Features
1. **Chat interface** with mock responses
2. **Response suggestions** based on email content
3. **Auto-compose** simulation
4. **Voice interaction** UI (non-functional)

#### Integration Features
1. **Calendar sidebar** with mock events
2. **Contact suggestions** for email composition
3. **Form detection** and auto-fill simulation
4. **Search functionality** with mock results

## Success Metrics for Prototype

### Day 1 Goals
- [ ] Three-panel layout renders correctly
- [ ] Email list displays 20+ mock emails
- [ ] Basic navigation works between panels
- [ ] Responsive design functions on mobile view

### Day 2 Goals
- [ ] Email viewer shows full email content
- [ ] AI chat interface accepts input
- [ ] Mock responses appear with realistic delays
- [ ] Voice UI elements are visually complete

### Day 3 Goals
- [ ] Navigation from main app works seamlessly
- [ ] All core interactions are functional
- [ ] Demo showcases key AI features
- [ ] Performance is smooth (60fps animations)

## Risk Mitigation

### Time Constraints
- **Fallback**: Reduce panel complexity if needed
- **Prioritization**: Focus on visual impact over deep functionality
- **Shortcuts**: Use existing statsai-electron components

### Technical Issues
- **Compatibility**: Test on Electron early and often
- **Performance**: Keep animations lightweight
- **Dependencies**: Avoid external libraries where possible

## Demo Script (5-minute presentation)

1. **Opening** (30s): Navigate to email assistant from main app
2. **Email Management** (2min): Show email list, selection, reading
3. **AI Features** (2min): Demonstrate chat interface, auto-responses
4. **Voice Integration** (30s): Show voice UI and interaction mockup
5. **Advanced Features** (1min): Calendar, forms, multi-channel integration

## Post-Prototype Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 2)
- Real email provider integration (Gmail API)
- Actual AI model integration (OpenAI API)
- Voice recording functionality
- Database for email storage

### Short-term Goals (Month 1)
- User authentication
- Real-time email sync
- Basic AI response generation
- Mobile app version

This plan focuses on creating a visually impressive and functionally demonstrable prototype that showcases the core value proposition while being achievable in the 3-day timeframe.
