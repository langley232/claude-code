## 🛠️ How to Use This Implementation

### For Xcode Development:

1. **Create New iOS Project** in Xcode:
   - Choose "App" template
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Language: Swift
   - iOS 15.0+ deployment target

2. **Copy Source Files**:
   - Drag all `.swift` files into your Xcode project
   - Organize into groups matching the folder structure
   - Ensure all files are added to the main target

3. **Configure API Key**:
   - Update `Constants.swift` with your Gemini API key
   - Configure Info.plist for network access

4. **Build and Test**:
   - The foundation is ready to compile
   - Add remaining ViewModels and Views as needed
   - Test on iOS Simulator and devices

### For Further Development:

1. **Start with SearchViewModel** - This is the core logic component
2. **Add ResultsView** - For displaying search results
3. **Implement remaining Views** - History, Settings, ContentView
4. **Add comprehensive testing** - Unit tests and UI tests
5. **Polish and optimize** - Animations, performance, accessibility
