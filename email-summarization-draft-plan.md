# üìã Email Summarization & AI Draft Generation Plan

## Current State Analysis ‚úÖ

### **Existing Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Basic summarization framework with `performIntelligentSummarization()`
- ‚úÖ Gemini API integration with `generateAISummary()`  
- ‚úÖ Mock AI responses in JSON for inbox overview
- ‚úÖ Quick action buttons for AI assistance
- ‚úÖ Context building from email threads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing**: Thread analysis and draft generation workflow

### **Current Limitations:**
- No actual email thread detection/grouping
- Limited mock responses for complex scenarios  
- No draft approval interface
- Missing context-aware response generation

## Implementation Plan üìù

### **1. Thread Analysis System** üßµ
**Functionality:**
- **Thread Detection**: Group emails by subject line patterns (Re:, Fwd:, etc.)
- **Conversation Mapping**: Link emails by message-id and references
- **Context Building**: Create chronological thread history
- **Participant Analysis**: Identify all thread participants and their roles

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Thread detection algorithms
findEmailThread(emailId) {
  // Group by subject similarity and participants
  // Sort chronologically 
  // Build conversation tree
}

buildThreadContext(thread) {
  // Extract key information from each email
  // Identify decision points and action items
  // Summarize overall conversation flow
}
```

### **2. Enhanced AI Summarization** ü§ñ
**Two-Tier Summarization:**

#### **A. Thread Summary** (When email has related conversations)
- **Conversation Overview**: Who said what, when, and why
- **Key Decisions Made**: Important agreements and conclusions
- **Outstanding Issues**: Unresolved questions or pending actions
- **Action Items**: What needs to be done and by whom
- **Context Timeline**: Chronological flow of the discussion

#### **B. Individual Email Summary** (Standalone emails)
- **Main Purpose**: Why the email was sent
- **Key Information**: Important details and data points  
- **Required Actions**: What the recipient needs to do
- **Deadline/Urgency**: Time-sensitive elements
- **Suggested Response**: Recommended reply approach

### **3. AI-Powered Draft Generation** ‚úçÔ∏è
**Smart Draft Creation Workflow:**

#### **Step 1: Context Analysis**
```
User clicks "Reply" or "Compose Response" 
‚Üì
AI analyzes:
‚Ä¢ Current email content and intent
‚Ä¢ Thread history and conversation flow  
‚Ä¢ Previous response patterns
‚Ä¢ Sender relationship and formality level
‚Ä¢ Urgency and priority indicators
```

#### **Step 2: Draft Generation**
```
AI generates contextual draft including:
‚Ä¢ Appropriate greeting/salutation
‚Ä¢ Reference to specific points from original email
‚Ä¢ Professional tone matching sender relationship
‚Ä¢ Action items and next steps
‚Ä¢ Proper closing and signature
```

#### **Step 3: User Approval Interface**
```
Present to user:
‚Ä¢ Thread summary (collapsible)
‚Ä¢ Generated draft with edit capabilities  
‚Ä¢ Suggested alternatives for key phrases
‚Ä¢ Send/Edit/Regenerate options
```

### **4. Smart Draft Interface Design** üé®

#### **A. Thread Summary Panel**
```html
<div class="thread-summary-panel">
  <div class="summary-header">
    <h3>üìß Thread Summary</h3>
    <button class="collapse-btn">‚ñº</button>
  </div>
  <div class="summary-content">
    <div class="conversation-timeline">
      <!-- Chronological thread overview -->
    </div>
    <div class="key-points">
      <!-- Important decisions and action items -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### **B. Draft Generation Interface**
```html
<div class="draft-interface">
  <div class="draft-header">
    <h3>ü§ñ AI-Generated Draft</h3>
    <div class="draft-actions">
      <button class="regenerate-btn">üîÑ Regenerate</button>
      <button class="edit-mode-btn">‚úèÔ∏è Edit</button>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="draft-content">
    <textarea class="draft-editor"><!-- Generated content --></textarea>
  </div>
  <div class="draft-suggestions">
    <!-- Alternative phrases and improvements -->
  </div>
  <div class="draft-footer">
    <button class="send-btn">üì§ Send</button>
    <button class="save-draft-btn">üíæ Save Draft</button>
    <button class="cancel-btn">‚ùå Cancel</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

### **5. Context-Aware Response Generation** üéØ

#### **Response Type Detection:**
- **Acknowledgment**: "Thank you" responses
- **Information Request**: Asking for details or clarification  
- **Decision Response**: Approving, declining, or providing feedback
- **Action Confirmation**: Confirming completion or next steps
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Calendar-related responses
- **Professional Update**: Status reports or progress updates

#### **Tone Adaptation:**
- **Internal Team**: Casual, direct, collaborative
- **Client/External**: Professional, formal, courteous
- **Executive Level**: Concise, strategic, actionable  
- **Vendor/Partner**: Business-focused, specific, clear

### **6. Mock Response Scenarios** üìö
