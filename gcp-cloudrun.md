# GCP Cloud Run Deployment Strategy

## Can you deploy through MCP server? YES!

You can use the Google MCP server to run gcloud commands for deployment - giving you the best of both worlds:

## Deployment Method:

1. **MCP Server** → Deploy and manage infrastructure via Claude commands
2. **gcloud CLI** → Actual deployment commands (fastest for trial credits)
3. **Terraform** → Optional, add later for production infrastructure

## Cost with Trial Credits:

- **n8n on Cloud Run**: $0-10/month
- **ElevenLabs service**: $0-5/month
- **Total**: $0-15/month from $300 credits = 20 months free

## Implementation Order:

1. **Today**: Set up Google MCP server (security + infrastructure management)
2. **This week**: Deploy n8n via gcloud run deploy commands through MCP
3. **Next week**: Deploy ElevenLabs service
4. **Later**: Add Terraform for production features (databases, VPC)

The Google MCP server gives you infrastructure control through Claude Code, while gcloud CLI provides the fastest deployment path for your trial credits. You get immediate deployment capability without the overhead of setting up Terraform initially.
